# Sphere CV Sample

This repo contains two main components:
1. (Work in progress) The SphereCV Unity project for generating ray traced synthetic data for a pink sphere
2. A set of python scripts for training a pytorch model (based on vgg16) to estimate the 2D bounding box for a pink spheres in images

Notes:
1. Noise textures used as random backgrounds for the SphereCV Unity project were sourced from the [Salzburg Texture Image Database (STex)](https://wavelab.at/sources/STex/).
